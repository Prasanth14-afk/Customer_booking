# Customer Booking â€” Dashboard

This is a minimalistic, elegant dashboard built with modern web tooling:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first minimal design
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Recharts for simple, beautiful charts
- PapaParse to read the CSV dataset

Quick start

1. cd dashboard
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 and explore the dashboard. The CSV dataset is available at `/data/customer_booking.csv` (served from `public/data`).

Notes

- The UI is intentionally minimal and uses gradients for visual interest.
- For production build: `npm run build` then `npm run preview` to preview the production bundle.
